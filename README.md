# Enemy Audios
This mod makes the enemies play the audio files you want!

## How to use 
Create a folder named EnemyAudios inside the REPO_Data folder, and just put all the funny audios you want in there.
Only the host must have the audio files, but everyone must have the mod.

Supported audio formats: .wav and .mp3

## Configuration
You can configure the sound volume, the delay between audio reproductions and which monsters are going to reproduce the audios in the game using the REPOConfig mod, but the default value for those configurations are:

- Volume: 75%
- Delay in seconds: 60s
- All the enemies

That's it! Have fun.
